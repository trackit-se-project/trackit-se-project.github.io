  <div class="container my-5">
    <p>
      So far we've developed a prototype that has 5 (to do list, calendar, notes, sleep and water tracker) basic 
      features out of a total of 7. We still have additional functionalities to develop on each feature, but it 
      is a working starting point.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, we showed the application to some of our closest fiends or famliy that had
      no interaction with it before. We also tried to choose some that have different backgrouds and age, to be sure
      that we are looking at different perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the application is still in developing mode, we showed it to them from our mobiles and
      looked closely to collect feedback. Here are some opinions that we find relevant and helpful to our purpose.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="container my-5">
    <h1><em>Users feedback</em></h1>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush py-3">
      <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">
        "My life is really stressful and I like the idea. To do list, notes and calendar are already 3 
        applications that I use. I would love to integrate canlendar and to do list somehow, for example, what 
        I put in the calendar to appear in the to do list zone as well for a certain day. Also, sleep and 
        water features sound good and looks very easy to use." (Georgiana, 24 years old, Medical Student)
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        "I am passionate about graphic design and I must say that the application looks very simple so far, I 
        would add more color to some pages. But the functionallity seems ok to me, I never thought to monitor 
        seep and water before, but sice it is that easy I would give it a chance. I use the rest of them constantly, 
        so it would be ok to me to use them in same app too." (Diana, 19 years old, Architecture Student)
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">
        "I think that the app has the basic implementation. In the future, try to add some suggestions in the 
        sleep and water apps. If I just to add the data and don't receive any feedback, I don't know if I'm doing 
        good. The rest of the features do what they should do, but I would make them to do more than other calendars, 
        notes and to do lists that already exist." (Adrian, 30 years old, Software Engineer)
      </li>

    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="container my-5">
    <h1><em>Conclusions</em></h1>
    <p>
    To sum up the feedback we received, we consider that people would give a chance to the idea that we
    support. The application is usefull even with the features that it has so far because it already has 5 different
    applications in one.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, we need to work more on the presenentation and style of each page and also in the notifications part.
    Also, we still have 2 more important features to develop (money and habits) that will give more value to the
    application in the future.
