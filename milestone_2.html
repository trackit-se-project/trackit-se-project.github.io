      Our plan for customer discovery: face to face interviews with people
      from different age demographics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of a did a face to face interview with a person from 23 to 52 years
      old. We used the same set of interview questions and analysed the
      answers to draw conclusions:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-group">
      <li class="list-group-item">
        The majority of the people we interviewed considered that it is
        important to monitor different aspects of their lives like: emotional
        state, sleeping patterns, consumed water, calories eaten and burned,
        time management. Some numbers at the end of the day may offer a new
        perspective and be a good motivation for anybody to change their
        lifestyle with a healthier one. Although important, no one wants to
        spend much time and energy on that.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Things that people want to keep an eye on: bad habits like too much
        TV/Netflix or car usage, a balanced diet and meals at regular times,
        physical exercises, factors of stress, sleep, procrastination, time
        management.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Most of the people use monitoring applications, but at some point they
        forget to update them because there are too many or because they are
        too busy. They also seem to be interested in an application that
        combines all in one product and it is personalised to match their
        desired activities. They found it also important that the application
        should put them in connection with people with similar interests and
        also give them recommendations from time to time.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        We observed that there is a tendency to split tasks according to
        external factors such as priorities given by the workplace. Most
        admitted that it is quite difficult to write a list and completing all
        the noted tasks, but writing would most likely help further
        accomplishment of the tasks.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        All the interviewed people considered it a useful thing to have an
        organized life because this would help them split between the
        activities they want to do, whether it is the tasks at work, the time
        spent with their family and friends or even have time for their your
        own person (hobbies, physical activities).
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        The answers varied, there were people who answered that they do not
        usually write such thoughts, some used to do this but now they don’t
        do it anymore, and those who answered that they do they write down
        quick ideas for later access and some write events that excited them
        and other emotional thoughts.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        The majority of people we interviewed do not keep up really closely
        with their spendings. They either use an Internet Banking application
        or they manage their finances using lists or just their intuition.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        Most of the people would like an application that has many features
        integrated so that they don’t have to install more than one app on
        their phones. Almost all of them said they wanted an user friendly
        interface with quick access to each feature. They are all interested
        in an application that is personalized to their lifestyles and can
        suggest recommendations based on their daily activities. The
        conclusion is that the people we interviewed want an application that
        can predict behaviour and recommend activities or diets with a minimum
        input from the user.
      </li>
      <li class="list-group-item">
        The majority of people we interviewed said they would like a free
        trial of the application. They would not spend money on something they
        aren’t sure they’re gonna like and use on a daily basis. After the
        trial is over, they would be willing to spend an average of 5 or 6
        euros for a monthly subscription.
