      <h2><em>Size of target market</em></h2>
      <p>
        Our main target market is: young adults (20 - 40 years old) or any other person that needs to keep track of
        different
        aspects in general as well. The population with these age range in Romania is about 40% of the total number,
        meaning 7.8
        millions of people. Among these, about 50% live in the urban area and only 80% have a smartphone, leaving us a
        total of
        3.12 millions of people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assuming that only 30% will try the application and that only 40% of them will actually purchase the application
        after
        the trial, then the market size is:
        <br />
        <b>(30 / 100) * (40 / 100) * Total number of target market * Price of
          application</b>

      <h2><em>Number of competitors</em></h2>
      <p>
        To make sure we are on the right track it is very important to keep an eye on our competitors. To find them the
        first
        step is to do what our potential customers would do to find the perfect product they are looking for:

      </p>
      <p>
        Our product is better than the rest of them on the market mostly because it takes the best features from each
        wellness
        app and incorporates everything in only one app. Our app is also designed to offer the basic needs of each
        individuals not
        targeting specific individuals as athletes, fitness enthusiasts or others. Our app it is that kind of app that
        can
        improve the overall quality of anybody’s life. After some searching we narrowed down our research to 3 main apps
        each of
        them being identified by us as the leader of each segment we want to target:

    <div class="container my-5">
      <h2><em>Competition and possible market share for each competitor</em></h2>
      <p>To achieve this goal we focused on our 3 main competitors described in the first milestone. Using a too like
        semrush.com
        we managed to collect valuable information about where we are on this market.

    <div class="container my-5">
      <h2><em>Potentian market share over a period of 5 years</em></h2>
      <p>
        A company's market share is its sales measured as a percentage of an industry's total revenues. You can
        determine a
        company's market share by dividing its total sales or revenues by the industry's total sales over a fiscal
        period.
      </p>
      <p>
        For estimation, we looked at some of our competitors’ revenue in October 2019. We estimated that that is their
        revenue
        for every month of this year.
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">Bullet Journal - 5k dollars revenue for October 2019 which means 60k dollars in
            2019
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Everyday - 5k dollars revenue for October 2019 which means 60k dollars in 2019
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Laviolet Bullet Journal - 5k dollars revenue for October 2019 which means 60k
            dollars in 2019
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Journal it! - 9k dollars revenue for October 2019 which means 108k dollars in 2019
          </li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Dreamie Planner - 5k dollars revenue for October 2019 which means 60k dollars
            in 2019</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">Daylio - 40k dollars revenue for October 2019 which means 480k dollars in 2019
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Since the majority of people become more and more focused on time management and self development, we assumed
        that the
        revenue will increase over the years.
      </p>
      <p><b>Year 1:</b> Total sales of the industry: 828k dollars. Our estimated sales: 30k dollars. That means that the
        market share in
        our first year is equal to 0.03 or 3%.
      </p>
      <p><b>Year 2:</b> Total sales of the industry: 900k dollars. Our estimated sales: 80k dollars. That means that the
        market share in
        our first year is equal to 0.08 or 8%.
      </p>
      <p><b>Year 3:</b> Total sales of the industry: 1m dollars. Our estimated sales: 110k dollars. That means that the
        market share in
        our first year is equal to 0.11 or 11%.</p>
      <p><b>Year 4:</b> Total sales of the industry: 1.5m dollars. Our estimated sales: 200k dollars. That means that
        the market share
        in our first year is equal to 0.13 or 13%.</p>
      <p><b>Year 5:</b> Total sales of the industry: 2m dollars. Our estimated sales: 300k dollars. That means that the
        market share in
        our first year is equal to 0.15 or 15%.</p>

      <p>Having the advantage of including multiple tools in a single app, we hope in five years Track it! will gain
        more
        popularity over the competition among users that want better time management and overall and improved lifestyle,
        and
        hold about 15% of the market share.</p>
