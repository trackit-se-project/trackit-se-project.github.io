    <h1><em>Problem</em></h1>
    <p>
      Lately, we have noticed a mutual problem at people with no common background: the chaos of everyday life. Many
      often
      complain about the amount of daily tasks they have so they postpone them until the last moment. Postponing can
      lead to
      more stress and therefore have a negative impact on one's health. When people begin to be conscious about it, they
      turn
      to apps to declutter their life. These apps consist of to do lists, notes, trackers etc, but the main issue is
      that
      there isn't an app which includes them all keeping up with more than one app can be time and energy consuming.

    <p>
      If a person wants to keep a journal, keep track of his habits, insert his daily activities and create a shopping
      list,
      he has to download at least 2 or 3 apps in order to do so. Track it! has all of these features integrated and it
      is
      designed to be that app that makes life easier and helps you stay organised and motivated. Our advantage over the
      competition is that, at the moment, there is no other app that has all of these specifications integrated.

    <h1><em>Key metrics</em></h1>
    <p>
      Key metrics are numbers and actions on the mobile application that matter to reach our strategic objectives. Here
      are a
      few points that we intend to follow:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
      <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Number of downloads and installs</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">App acquisition - where the downloads came from</li>
      <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Active users - Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly Active Users
        (MAU)</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Average Daily Sessions Per Daily Active Users - the number of sessions per day divided
        by the number of DAU</li>
      <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Average session length</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Number of accesses per page/feature</li>
      <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Retention Rate - how many users return to the app after using it
        previously within a
        set period of time</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Churn Rate - the opposite of retention rate, how many users stopped using the app
        after the same set period of time</li>
      <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Average revenue per user (ARPU) - the total revenue divided by the
        number of subscriptions</li>
      <li class="list-group-item">Cost per acquisition (CPA) - how much acquiring new users costs</li>
      <li class="list-group-item bg-dark text-light">Return on investment (ROI) - measures the gain or loss generated by

        the app</li>

    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="container my-5">
    <h1><em>Cost structure</em></h1>
    <p>
      Buying an already developed application can imply an very high cost for a startup, considering a rough estimation
      provided by a simple site like howmuchtomakeanapp.com an application containing the features needed by trackIT can
      cost
      as much as 30.000$. The application development is not a kind of task that can be avoided for the aims of this
      kind of
      business for reducing such a high price we can take advantage of our own team programming experience. In the
      beginning
      we could launch a beta version of an application and test it on a small group of target users which can provide us
      some
      feedback.

    </p>
    <p>After that we can take into consideration that the cost of publishing an application on Google Play is 25$ one
      time fee
      and in case we consider extending the market the Apple App Store will add an 99$ annual developer fee.
      However, if we develop an application that can be accessed through browser the hosting cost for the domain name
      would be
      a monthly fee that depends on the name chosen.

    <h1><em>Revenue streams</em></h1>

      the app will be available for free download but will also include a paid subscription for extended features. The
